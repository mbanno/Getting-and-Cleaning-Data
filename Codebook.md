## Overview
This codebook provides description of the **tidy** data. This tidy data was generated by R script(run_analysis.R). See the README for the detail of the run_analysis.R.

## Datasource
[Human Activity Recognition database ](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

## Brief description of the variable
*Features(third column and after) are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
